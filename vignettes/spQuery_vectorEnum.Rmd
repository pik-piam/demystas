Other than greps-type functions, `demystas` provides other interesting and useful functions which fall under the categories of spatial querying and vector enumeration. Following are the key functions:

1. `coords2spi`: overlays coordinates of class data frame, SpatialPoints or SpatialPointsDataFrame onto a global polygon of class SpatialPolygonsDataFrame.

2. `spNearest`: used to complement the `coords2spi` function by finding the nearest polygon to points that do not lie directly on a polygon. This function should be used on unprojected coordinates ie. lon/lat, ideally with the WGS84 ellipsoid.

3. `vectorEnum`: uniquely enumerates a vector's components regardless of the order or distribution of duplicated components. Useful for cases where duplicate components of vectors are not permitted and exact order must be preserved.

## 1. `coords2spi` function





















#> for coords2spi, show advantage over "over" because of no need for projection, use some examples from old set
#> for spNearest, advantage is that algorithm searches for nearest polygon, but must be used with unprojected coordinates, use examples from set and explain intelligent mechanisms
#> for vectorEnum, give complexly distributed vector which needs to be made unique and needs to account for its uniqueness while preserving order
